The decision to learn web development came in small steps over many years. I studied mechanical engineering in school and have been working in the Space Systems industry since then. While I found my job a challenge, I was content to explore schematics, stress analysis and parts lists. After a decade of working in the same industry, however, I wanted a change.

I had studied a mechatronics specialization in college, so I have always embraced using computers to control motion and solve problems. I have always enjoyed puzzles and logic problems. I decided to take the first step to a career in coding/web development. I took some java classes in school, then later, a hodgepodge of coding lessons online. These whetted my interest in the greater software and web world. 

Throughout the last decade or so, my personal life has changed as well. I was now working 40 miles from my home, commuting in Bay Area traffic. I had a baby, so now am juggling time with her, time at work, time for chores, time for my husband, and time for me. When my position was going to be moved to another state, that was the push I needed to get serious. 

I joined Flatiron Web Developer Online Bootcamp as a way to get the skills I need to pursue a full time career. The flexible schedule allows me to work when I can, still leaving time for work and the family. This is the right choice for me. I am confident that with my persistence, my skills will evolve and I can find the perfect job and career for me.
