This week, I started the CLI Ruby Gem Portfolio Project. I have run into some real challenges this week and have not made the progress that I had hoped.

1. Finding the right project for me. 

I had originally intended to create a Gem that scraped the New York Times and displays information about the Bestsellers list. I began laying out how the user would interact with the CLI and finding the information from the website that I would need. It occurred to me after I began this process to check and see if there was already a Gem similar to the one I intended to create. There was. So, I went back to the drawing board. 

* I decided to go after something near and dear to my heart - food. I decided my Gem would scrape the Eater SF Heatmap and provide the user with information about the restaurants. This time I did a check before I began any work on the Gem. I was good to go.

2. Setting up a Ruby environment separate from the Learn IDE. 

Honestly, this is the number one reason why I am behind where I need to be right now. I don't understand anything about the $PATH and the bash profile, so I spent a week learning about why I can't install my gem. I watched videos, downloaded Homebrew and rbenv, and I still can't get anything to work properly. And this is after I spent a day configuring my git ssh. I haven't even touched my actual app yet.

* I plan on sitting down for an evening and uninstalling and reinstalling everything carefully. I plan on reaching out to whomever can help me on the Learn platform or on Stack Overflow, or any other site. I will complete this task in the next couple of days.

3. Motivation

Since this process has been so cumbersome, I'm losing steam. I really want to move on to something I can achieve, but since I'm getting nowhere fast, I find myself blocking myself from working on it. 

* I had a good talk with my counselor, who was able to point me to several help options. I find that we have a good community of people who are vested in your success. I have a new motto this week of "Let's get this done."


I plan that my next blog article will be about how I successfully completed my Ruby Gem Project!
