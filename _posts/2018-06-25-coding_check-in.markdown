## Take a breath

It has been almost six months since I began my coding classes at Flatiron. Since then, I have covered topics including Ruby (basics and OOP), SQL, Git/Github, HTML/CSS, ORMS/ActiveRecord, Sinatra, and Rails. Programming feels more natural to me, and I finally am beginning to feel like a programmer.

A lot of this is from the final projects that I have completed. It is one thing to complete labs, with tests that someone else designed, but quite another to conceive of an idea, and be able to bring that idea to life. 

The first portfolio project was the CLI Ruby Gem Project. I created a Gem that scraped the Eater SF Heat Map and Essential 38 lists and displayed the restaurant information. This program required knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, scraping websites, and working with the Command Line. Some of the main learning subjects included class vs. instance variables/methods, object instantiation and logic/conditionals/looping. This was also the first project that we needed to build from scratch on our computer and use git/github to track commits.

The second portfolio project was a Sinatra Web App. This application runs from the browser and has signup/login/logout capabilities. My app was an activity tracker for triathlon events (swim/bike/run). My app has a User model that `has_many` Log models. Each log has a date, and then optional distances for swim/bike/run - you don't need to log all 3, but you do need at least 1 activity to save a log. The main learning subjects for this project included routing, model validations, error handling, and accessing the database. We used Sinatra (http://sinatrarb.com/) and ActiveRecord (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) to manage the models and routing.

The next portfolio project will be in Rails, which I am currently learning. This builds on the Sinatra section and covers RESTful routes, user authentification and secure passwords. I have begun to brainstorm possible project outlines, and am excited to complete this project because Rails is a marketable skill and will be a boon to my resume.

### Wrap-up

As with learning anything, there are parts that I found super interesting and challenging, and others dull or frustrating. The goal is stay motivated and learning and understanding why things are done. I am still enjoying my Flatiron experience and am excited to be moving forward steadily.  The online learning experience can be isolating and hard to stay on track, but with the monthly checkins and help desk available 7 days a week, I feel well supported.
